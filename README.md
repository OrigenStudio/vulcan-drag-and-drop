# Vulcan drag and drop (WIP)

Provides helpers to easily integrate drag and drop in Vulcan projects. Uses [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Right now the package doesn't do much. It only export some HOCs in order for you to easily create custom drag and drop components. Feature ideas and feedback will be much appreciated!


## Installation

Add the package to meteor by running:

```bash
meteor add origenstudio:vulcan-drag-and-drop
```

And then install the required `npm` packages:

```bash
meteor npm install react-beautiful-dnd
```
